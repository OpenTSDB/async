/**
 * A thread-safe implementation of a deferred result for easy asynchronous
 * processing.
 * <p>
 * This implementation is based on <a href="http://goo.gl/avIOWO">Twisted's
 * Python {@code Deferred} API</a>.
 *
 * This API is a simple and elegant way of managing asynchronous and dynamic
 * "pipelines" (processing chains) without having to explicitly define a
 * finite state machine.
 *
 * <h1>The tl;dr version</h1>
 *
 * We're all busy and don't always have time to RTFM in details.  Please pay
 * special attention to the <a href="#warranty">invariants</a> you must
 * respect.  Other than that, here's an executive summary of what
 * {@code Deferred} offers:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A {@code Deferred} is like a {@link java.util.concurrent.Future} with
 * a dynamic {@link Callback} chain associated to it.</li>
 * <li>When the deferred result becomes available, the callback chain gets
 * triggered.</li>
 * <li>The result of one callback in the chain is passed on to the next.</li>
 * <li>When a callback returns another {@code Deferred}, the next callback in
 * the chain doesn't get executed until that other {@code Deferred} result
 * becomes available.</li>
 * <li>There are actually two callback chains.  One is for normal processing,
 * the other is for error handling / recovery.  A {@link Callback} that handles
*  errors is called an "errback".</li>
*  <li>{@code Deferred} is an important building block for writing easy-to-use
*  asynchronous APIs in a thread-safe fashion.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h1>Understanding the concept of {@code Deferred}</h1>
 *
 * The idea is that a {@code Deferred} represents a result that's not yet
 * available.  An asynchronous operation (I/O, RPC, whatever) has been started
 * and will hand its result (be it successful or not) to the {@code Deferred}
 * in the future.  The key difference between a {@code Deferred} and a
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.Future Future} is that a {@code Deferred} has
 * a <strong>callback chain</strong> associated to it, whereas with just a
 * {@code Future} you need get the result manually at some point, which poses
 * problems such as: How do you know when the result is available?  What if
 * the result itself depends on another future?
 * <p>
 * When you start an asynchronous operation, you typically want to be called
 * back when the operation completes.  If the operation was successful, you
 * want your callback to use its result to carry on what you were doing at
 * the time you started the asynchronous operation.  If there was an error,
 * you want to trigger some error handling code.
 * <p>
 * But there's more to a {@code Deferred} than a single callback.  You can add
 * arbitrary number of callbacks, which effectively allows you to easily build
 * complex processing pipelines in a really simple and elegant way.
 *
 * <h2>Understanding the callback chain</h2>
 * Let's take a typical example.  You're writing a client library for others
 * to use your simple remote storage service.  When your users call the {@code
 * get} method in your library, you want to retrieve some piece of data from
 * your remote service and hand it back to the user, but you want to do so in
 * an asynchronous fashion.
 * <p>
 * When the user of your client library invokes {@code get}, you assemble a
 * request and send it out to the remote server through a socket.  Before
 * sending it to the socket, you create a {@code Deferred} and you store it
 * somewhere, for example in a map, to keep an association between the request
 * and this {@code Deferred}.  You then return this {@code Deferred} to the
 * user, this is how they will access the deferred result as soon as the RPC
 * completes.
 * <p>
 * Sooner or later, the RPC will complete (successfully or not), and your
 * socket will become readable (or maybe closed, in the event of a failure).
 * Let's assume for now that everything works as expected, and thus the socket
 * is readable, so you read the response from the socket.  At this point you
 * extract the result of the remote {@code get} call, and you hand it out to
 * the {@code Deferred} you created for this request (remember, you had to
 * store it somewhere, so you could give it the deferred result once you have
 * it).  The {@code Deferred} then stores this result and triggers any
 * callback that may have been added to it.  The expectation is that the user
 * of your client library, after calling your {@code get} method, will add a
 * {@link Callback} to the {@code Deferred} you gave them.  This way, when the
 * deferred result becomes available, you'll call it with the result in
 * argument.
 * <p>
 * So far what we've explained is nothing more than a {@code Future} with a
 * callback associated to it.  But there's more to {@code Deferred} than just
 * this.  Let's assume now that someone else wants to build a caching layer on
 * top of your client library, to avoid repeatedly {@code get}ting the same
 * value over and over again through the network.  Users who want to use the
 * cache will invoke {@code get} on the caching library instead of directly
 * calling your client library.
 * <p>
 * Let's assume that the caching library already has a result cached for a
 * {@code get} call.  It will create a {@code Deferred}, and immediately hand
 * it the cached result, and it will return this {@code Deferred} to the user.
 * The user will add a {@link Callback} to it, which will be immediately
 * invoked since the deferred result is already available.  So the entire
 * {@code get} call completed virtually instantaneously and entirely from the
 * same thread.  There was no context switch (no other thread involved, no
 * I/O and whatnot), nothing ever blocked, everything just happened really
 * quickly.
 * <p>
 * Now let's assume that the caching library has a cache miss and needs to do
 * a remote {@code get} call using the original client library described
 * earlier.  The RPC is sent out to the remote server and the client library
 * returns a {@code Deferred} to the caching library.  This is where things
 * become exciting.  The caching library can then add its own callback to the
 * {@code Deferred} before returning it to the user.  This callback will take
 * the result that came back from the remote server, add it to the cache and
 * return it.  As usual, the user then adds their own callback to process the
 * result.  So now the {@code Deferred} has 2 callbacks associated to it:
 * <pre>
 *              1st callback       2nd callback
 *
 *   Deferred:  add to cache  -->  user callback
 * </pre>
 * When the RPC completes, the original client library will de-serialize the
 * result from the wire and hand it out to the {@code Deferred}.  The first
 * callback will be invoked, which will add the result to the cache of the
 * caching library.  Then whatever the first callback returns will be passed
 * on to the second callback.  It turns out that the caching callback returns
 * the {@code get} response unchanged, so that will be passed on to the user
 * callback.
 * <p>
 * Now it's very important to understand that the first callback could have
 * returned another arbitrary value, and that's what would have been passed
 * to the second callback.  This may sound weird at first but it's actually
 * the key behind {@code Deferred}.
 * <p>
 * To illustrate why, let's complicate things a bit more.  Let's assume the
 * remote service that serves those {@code get} requests is a fairly simple
 * and low-level storage service (think {@code memcached}), so it only works
 * with byte arrays, it doesn't care what the contents is.  So the original
 * client library is only de-serializing the byte array from the network and
 * handing that byte array to the {@code Deferred}.
 * <p>
 * Now you're writing a higher-level library that uses this storage system
 * to store some of your custom objects.  So when you get the byte array from
 * the server, you need to further de-serialize it into some kind of an object.
 * Users of your higher-level library don't care about what kind of remote
 * storage system you use, the only thing they care about is {@code get}ting
 * those objects asynchronously.  Your higher-level library is built on top
 * of the original low-level library that does the RPC communication.
 * <p>
 * When the users of the higher-level library call {@code get}, you call
 * {@code get} on the lower-level library, which issues an RPC call and
 * returns a {@code Deferred} to the higher-level library.  The higher-level
 * library then adds a first callback to further de-serialize the byte array
 * into an object.  Then the user of the higher-level library adds their own
 * callback that does something with that object.  So now we have something
 * that looks like this:
 * <pre>
 *              1st callback                    2nd callback
 *
 *   Deferred:  de-serialize to an object  -->  user callback
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * When the result comes in from the network, the byte array is de-serialized
 * from the socket.  The first callback is invoked and its argument is the
 * <strong>initial result</strong>, the byte array.  So the first callback
 * further de-serializes it into some object that it returns.  The second
 * callback is then invoked and its argument is <strong>the result of the
 * previous callback</strong>, that is the de-serialized object.
 * <p>
 * Now back to the caching library, which has nothing to do with the higher
 * level library.  All it does is, given an object that implements some
 * interface with a {@code get} method, it keeps a map of whatever arguments
 * {@code get} receives to an {@code Object} that was cached for this
 * particular {@code get} call.  Thanks to the way the callback chain works,
 * it's possible to use the caching library together with the higher-level
 * library transparently.  Users who want to use caching simply need to
 * use the caching library together with the higher level library.  Now when
 * they call {@code get} on the caching library, and there's a cache miss,
 * here's what happens, step by step:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>The caching library calls {@code get} on the higher-level
 *       library.</li>
 *   <li>The higher-level library calls {@code get} on the lower-level
 *       library.</li>
 *   <li>The lower-level library creates a {@code Deferred}, issues out the
 *       RPC call and returns its {@code Deferred}.</li>
 *   <li>The higher-level library adds its own object de-serialization
 *       callback to the {@code Deferred} and returns it.</li>
 *   <li>The caching library adds its own cache-updating callback to the
 *       {@code Deferred} and returns it.</li>
 *   <li>The user gets the {@code Deferred} and adds their own callback
 *       to do something with the object retrieved from the data store.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <pre>
 *              1st callback       2nd callback       3rd callback
 *
 *   Deferred:  de-serialize  -->  add to cache  -->  user callback
 *   result: (none available)
 * </pre>
 * Once the response comes back, the first callback is invoked, it
 * de-serializes the object, returns it.  The <em>current result</em> of the
 * {@code Deferred} becomes the de-serialized object.  The current state of
 * the {@code Deferred} is as follows:
 * <pre>
 *              2nd callback       3rd callback
 *
 *   Deferred:  add to cache  -->  user callback
 *   result: de-serialized object
 * </pre>
 * Because there are more callbacks in the chain, the {@code Deferred} invokes
 * the next one and gives it the current result (the de-serialized object) in
 * argument.  The callback adds that object to its cache and returns it
 * unchanged.
 * <pre>
 *              3rd callback
 *
 *   Deferred:  user callback
 *   result: de-serialized object
 * </pre>
 * Finally, the user's callback is invoked with the object in argument.
 * <pre>
 *   Deferred:  (no more callbacks)
 *   result: (whatever the user's callback returned)
 * </pre>
 * If you think this is becoming interesting, read on, you haven't reached the
 * most interesting thing about {@code Deferred} yet.
 *
 * <h2>Building dynamic processing pipelines with {@code Deferred}</h2>
 * Let's complicate the previous example a little bit more.  Let's assume that
 * the remote storage service that serves those {@code get} calls is a
 * distributed service that runs on many machines.  The data is partitioned
 * over many nodes and moves around as nodes come and go (due to machine
 * failures and whatnot).  In order to execute a {@code get} call, the
 * low-level client library first needs to know which server is currently
 * serving that piece of data.  Let's assume that there's another server,
 * which is part of that distributed service, that maintains an index and
 * keeps track of where each piece of data is.  The low-level client library
 * first needs to lookup the location of the data using that first server
 * (that's a first RPC), then retrieves it from the storage node (that's
 * another RPC).  End users don't care that retrieving data involves a 2-step
 * process, they just want to call {@code get} and be called back when the
 * data (a byte array) is available.
 * <p>
 * This is where what's probably the most useful feature of {@code Deferred}
 * comes in.  When the user calls {@code get}, the low-level library will issue
 * a first RPC to the index server to locate the piece of data requested by the
 * user.  When issuing this {@code lookup} RPC, a {@code Deferred} gets
 * created.  The low-level {@code get} code adds a first callback to process
 * the {@code lookup} response and then returns it to the user.
 * <pre>
 *              1st callback       2nd callback
 *
 *   Deferred:  index lookup  -->  user callback
 *   result: (none available)
 * </pre>
 * Eventually, the {@code lookup} RPC completes, and the {@code Deferred} is
 * given the {@code lookup} response.  So before triggering the first
 * callback, the {@code Deferred} will be in this state:
 * <pre>
 *              1st callback       2nd callback
 *
 *   Deferred:  index lookup  -->  user callback
 *   result: lookup response
 * </pre>
 * The first callback runs and now knows where to find the piece of data
 * initially requested.  It issues the {@code get} request to the right storage
 * node.  Doing so creates <em>another</em> {@code Deferred}, let's call it
 * {@code (B)}, which is then returned by the {@code index lookup} callback.
 * And this is where the magic happens.  Now we're in this state:
 * <pre>
 *   (A)        2nd callback    |   (B)
 *                              |
 *   Deferred:  user callback   |   Deferred:  (no more callbacks)
 *   result: Deferred (B)       |   result: (none available)
 * </pre>
 * Because a callback returned a {@code Deferred}, we can't invoke the user
 * callback just yet, since the user doesn't want their callback receive a
 * {@code Deferred}, they want it to receive a byte array.  The current
 * callback gets <em>paused</em> and stops processing the callback chain.
 * This callback chain needs to be resumed whenever the {@code Deferred} of
 * the {@code get} call [{@code (B)}] completes.  In order to achieve that, a
 * callback is added to that other {@code Deferred} that will <em>resume</em>
 * the execution of the callback chain.
 * <pre>
 *   (A)        2nd callback    |   (B)        1st callback
 *                              |
 *   Deferred:  user callback   |   Deferred:  resume (A)
 *   result: Deferred (B)       |   result: (none available)
 * </pre>
 * Once {@code (A)} added the callback on {@code (B)}, it can return
 * immediately, there's no need to wait, block a thread or anything like that.
 * So the whole process of receiving the {@code lookup} response and sending
 * out the {@code get} RPC happened really quickly, without blocking anything.
 * <p>
 * Now when the {@code get} response comes back from the network, the RPC
 * layer de-serializes the byte array, as usual, and hands it to {@code (B)}:
 * <pre>
 *   (A)        2nd callback    |   (B)        1st callback
 *                              |
 *   Deferred:  user callback   |   Deferred:  resume (A)
 *   result: Deferred (B)       |   result: byte array
 * </pre>
 * {@code (B)}'s first and only callback is going to set the result of
 * {@code (A)} and resume {@code (A)}'s callback chain.
 * <pre>
 *   (A)        2nd callback    |   (B)        1st callback
 *                              |
 *   Deferred:  user callback   |   Deferred:  resume (A)
 *   result: byte array         |   result: byte array
 * </pre>
 * So now {@code (A)} resumes its callback chain, and invokes the user's
 * callback with the byte array in argument, which is what they wanted.
 * <pre>
 *   (A)                        |   (B)        1st callback
 *                              |
 *   Deferred:  (no more cb)    |   Deferred:  resume (A)
 *   result: (return value of   |   result: byte array
 *            the user's cb)
 * </pre>
 * Then {@code (B)} moves on to its next callback in the chain, but there are
 * none, so {@code (B)} is done too.
 * <pre>
 *   (A)                        |   (B)
 *                              |
 *   Deferred:  (no more cb)    |   Deferred:  (no more cb)
 *   result: (return value of   |   result: byte array
 *            the user's cb)
 * </pre>
 * The whole process of reading the {@code get} response, resuming the initial
 * {@code Deferred} and executing the second {@code Deferred} happened all in
 * the same thread, sequentially, and without blocking anything (provided that
 * the user's callback didn't block, as it must not).
 * <p>
 * What we've done is essentially equivalent to dynamically building an
 * implicit finite state machine to handle the life cycle of the {@code get}
 * request.  This simple API allows you to build arbitrarily complex
 * processing pipelines that make dynamic decisions at each stage of the
 * pipeline as to what to do next.
 *
 * <h2>Handling errors</h2>
 * A {@code Deferred} has in fact not one but two callback chains.  The first
 * chain is the "normal" processing chain, and the second is the error
 * handling chain.  Twisted calls an error handling callback an "errback", so
 * we've kept that term here.  When the asynchronous processing completes with
 * an error, the {@code Deferred} must be given the {@link Exception} that was
 * caught instead of giving it the result (or if no {@link Exception} was
 * caught, one must be created and handed to the {@code Deferred}).  When the
 * current result of a {@code Deferred} is an instance of {@link Exception},
 * the next errback is invoked.  As for normal callbacks, whatever the errback
 * returns becomes the current result.  If the current result is still an
 * instance of {@link Exception}, the next errback is invoked.  If the current
 * result is no longer an {@link Exception}, the next callback is invoked.
 * <p>
 * When a callback or an errback itself <em>throws</em> an exception, it is
 * caught by the {@code Deferred} and becomes the current result, which means
 * that the next errback in the chain will be invoked with that exception in
 * argument.  Note that {@code Deferred} will only catch {@link Exception}s,
 * not any {@link Throwable} or {@link Error}.

 *
 * Read this carefully as this is your warranty.
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A {@code Deferred} can receive only one initial result.</li>
 *   <li>Only one thread at a time is going to execute the callback chain.</li>
 *   <li>Each action taken by a callback
 *       <a href="http://goo.gl/361hAV">happens-before</a> the next
 *       callback is invoked.  In other words, if a callback chain manipulates
 *       a variable (and no one else manipulates it), no synchronization is
 *       required.</li>
 *   <li>The thread that executes the callback chain is the thread that hands
 *       the initial result to the {@code Deferred}.  This class does not
 *       create or manage any thread or executor.</li>
 *   <li>As soon as a callback is executed, the {@code Deferred} will lose its
 *       reference to it.</li>
 *   <li>Every method that adds a callback to a {@code Deferred} does so in
 *       {@code O(1)}.</li>
 *   <li>A {@code Deferred} cannot receive itself as an initial or
 *       intermediate result, as this would cause an infinite recursion.</li>
 *   <li>You must not build a cycle of mutually dependant {@code Deferred}s,
 *       as this would cause an infinite recursion (thankfully, it will
 *       quickly fail with a {@link CallbackOverflowError}).</li>
 *   <li>Callbacks and errbacks cannot receive a {@code Deferred} in
 *       argument.  This is because they always receive the result of a
 *       previous callback, and when the result becomes a {@code Deferred},
 *       we suspend the execution of the callback chain until the result of
 *       that other {@code Deferred} is available.</li>
 *   <li>Callbacks cannot receive an {@link Exception} in argument.  This
 *       because they're always given to the errbacks.</li>
 *   <li>Using the monitor of a {@code Deferred} can lead to a deadlock, so
